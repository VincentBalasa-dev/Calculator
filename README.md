# 📝 Calculator

A **React.js** calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations with a clean, responsive interface.
This project was created on **freeCodeCamp** to practice **React hooks**, **state management**, and **dynamic UI updates**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
This project demonstrates building a functional calculator using **React functional components**.
Users can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, use decimals, toggle negative values, and clear the display in real-time.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Perform arithmetic operations: **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, **division**
- Handle **decimal points** and **negative numbers**
- **Clear display** with a dedicated AC button
- Responsive **4x5 grid layout** using Tailwind CSS
- Dynamic button styling with **gradient colors** for a polished UI
- Real-time display updates with **overflow handling**

---

## 🧠 Concepts Demonstrated
- React functional components
- useState hook for managing display and calculation state
- Event handling for button clicks
- Controlled component design for dynamic display
- Conditional rendering for handling special cases (e.g., negative, decimal, divide by zero)

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- React (via CDN on CodePen)  
- Babel for JSX compilation  
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design and styling
